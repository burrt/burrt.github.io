# Welcome

Hi, I'm Geoffrey Choy, a passionate and curious Software Engineer! I'm always seeking to expand my technical skill set and to discover the ingredients of software excellence and team culture.

With the rise of new technologies,
innovations and challenges; I am fascinated about how the industry solves large, complex problems at
scale – particularly Distributed Systems!

## Projects

### Implementing the MIPS I MMU - FPGA

After completing my Thesis, which was to implement the MMU for a bare-metal MIPS I processor, the next logical step was to boot a modified Linux kernel on it. This requirement brought many challenges I hadn't been exposed to such as understanding the OS and hardware integration, cross-compiler toolchains and instruction set simulators.

I was able to successfully boot the Linux kernel on the synthesized MIPS R3000 processor and it is without a doubt, one of my greatest
achievements!

### Personal Website

Although this may seem trivial for Software Engineers, I initially created a basic static webpage in 2017. Last year, I've reworked it to take advantage of Jekyll/Markdown after many excuses of delaying this project! Some of the motivations for the change were scaling concerns, Markdown support and maintainability.

I believe breaking the procrastination barrier and making consistent
small steps, will allow me to achieve my end goal (secret)!
