# Welcome

Hi, I'm Geoffrey Choy, a recent Computer Engineering graduate from UNSW.

I'm looking to expand my existing skill set and learn how today's software companies are solving large, complex problems that I haven’t been exposed to!

I'm also really passionate about Operating and Distributed Systems, and love learning new things in the computing world.

## Projects

### Implementing the MIPS I MMU - FPGA

After completing my Computer Engineering Thesis at UNSW which was implementing the MMU for an existing bare-metal MIPS I processor, the next logical step was to boot a modified Linux Kernel on it.

I needed to learn many new, challenging and interesting topics before I could begin my task. This included learning about how the Linux Kernel integrates with hardware, cross-compiler toolchains and instruction set simulators.

In the end, I managed to successfully boot the Linux Kernel on the MIPS R3000 and it was an incredible journey!

### Personal Website

Although this may seem trivial for Software Engineers, I initially created a basic static webpage in 2017.

Now, in May 2019, I've reworked it to take advantage of Jekyll! Some of the motivations for the change were scaling concerns, Markdown support and maintainability.
