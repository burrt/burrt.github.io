## Things in motion

It occurred to me that being in motion is essential to life - being immobile or stationary for excessive periods of time is extremely detrimental our lives. Take for example the emphasis on regular exercise, without it our fat-muscle ratio increases, along with a plethora of health problems. In extreme situations such as space for example, astronauts are in zero-gravity; if they were to skip their regular physical exercises, this leads to life-threatening consequences as they re-adapt to the earth's gravity.

This also extends to non-human aspects such as train tracks - without constant friction, metals corrode and weaken, the earth itself is in continual rotation, space is expanding... We are only without motion at the end of our lifetimes, a sobering thought.
