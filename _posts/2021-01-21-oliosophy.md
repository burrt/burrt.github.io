# Oliosophy

A philosophy my squash coach imparted upon me over the years, from when I first started learning squash to the realisation his lessons were more than just squash. I never thought I would encounter philosophy on the squash courts, particularly when I was new to the sport but it had made all the difference. So you might be wondering, what is "Oliosophy"? Is it just another trending "how to live your life in the 202X world"? No, it is more akin to Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*, fragmented learnings, lessons and reflections in the flow of life...

## The River of Life

> You only need to think about the ball you're going to hit right now, not the one that just went, or the next ball - now.
> Think of it as if you are standing by the riverbed watching the water pass you, at that point it does is what matters - not the sticks or water that went, but the moment it reaches you. Focus on that and then move on.

## Never just be "in" the Game, be "in" and "out" of the Game

> Never be in the game, you'll get lost, heated, tired, worried - but be outside of the game, above it! From there you see the birds-eye-view and there you're the puppeteer. The game is now about moving in and out of it - like your focus on a squash ball; a constant flux of narrow and wide.

As you watch the ball in squash come off the racquet strings of your opponent, your focus is narrowed, your vision tunnelled on that single point. Nothing else matters. Then the ball flies off and your focus relaxes, your limbs move as your brain subconsciously maps the trajectory and your vision expands, noticing the opponent move also.

We too react like so in life, but most of us are stuck in the game, our focus narrow, tunnel visioned, spiralling down the rat-race. We fail this basic discipline of taking a step back, re-evaluate, change and adjust. There's so many distractions, social media, FOMO, all swirling in our vision and so our discipline weakens and is tempted. Understand and notice this in your life and others.

## It's Too Hard

> It's not too hard, what's so hard about it? *Excuses rattling off*... No, it's not too hard, instead say "You can do it".

Easier said than done. That is true in part but it can be overcome, it's all up to you. Naturally when I first started learning squash, I lacked confidence in my ability and skill of the game although there is more to it. My own self-confidence and self-esteem were similarly low and my coach highlighted my frequent use of indecisive words: *"maybe I can do it", "not sure"*... And so my journey began of not saying "that shot is too hard Ollie", "I just can't do it", and slowly it started of a silent "I can do it" to a couple of years later; "I can do it Ollie, I just need to practice and do it."

The power of words is tremendous, many notable psychology studies have shown how positive reinforcement can have significant positive effects on your actions []. Identify what stops you from achieving the results, often it will be you. Don't be afraid, don't let fear control you - prepare, do the work and embrace it.

## To Change, you must first change your Thinking

> To change your life, change your thinking.

All those times when my coach was fixing a certain technique of my stroke or when he was teaching me a new one, he would always reply to struggles, be it verbal or not, with "change your thinking." In my attempts to adjust my the swing arc or slant of my racquet, the ingrained muscle memory and autonomous nature of our mind resists - and naturally we relax, it's easy to say at this point, "it's too hard." But it isn't, and the seeds of change starts by changing your thinking since the brain is what controls everything else, including my muscles.

And we can see this ripple out into our lives where often we spew a list of excuses against change, and our focus is usually directed to the excuses and obstacles, not to our thinking. After all, who likes to blame themselves?

## Before you can control any situation, you must control yourself

> Before you can control any situation, you must first control yourself.

Control is paramount in squash; he who controls the tempo, their shots, their movements, controls the game. To win a game, you must master your shots and your own movements before you can master the game - how can you master the game if you can't master how and where you hit a squash ball?

This isn't to encourage being a control-freak or micro-manage, but to identify and understand what to control first before controlling more. It is also critical to know what is outside your sphere of control - do not be tempted to obtain what you cannot control as it comes with a heavy price.
