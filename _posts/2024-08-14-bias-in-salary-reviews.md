# Bias in salary reviews

So this topic has been heavily discussed and debated in many mediums - I will not talk about it at length. What I will say, is a remark a former colleague made to me on salary reviews.

Okay, let's set the stage:

* her ethnicity is a minority group
* the manager was a white, middle-aged man
* she had recently relocated to the country
* he had been in the company for more than five years

Now I'm not being snarky with any of the comments and neither implying anything (yet). The salary conversions involves a 1-1 conversation with the manager in which he asks essentially: "what salary do you expect?".

There are so many things wrong with this approach.

Ignoring the obvious ones, she highlighted the fact it would be far more productive and fair if there was **no** 1-1 at all, and instead she was presented with a range of pay increases to "opt" for. This removes any verbal negotiation and it becomes far more transaction, although not entirely removing the bias.

But this approach made me re-think about the process and how unfair it can really be with different genders, cultures etc. On that note, she received well below the average pay rise in her business unit. This is 2024 too.
