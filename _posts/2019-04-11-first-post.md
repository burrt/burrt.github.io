excerpt: My new website with Jekyll
---

*Basically I finally got around to redoing my Github Pages website with Jekyll after a length process!*

## Why

So I first heard about Jekyll many years ago with its excellent support with Markdown notes - I just never bothered to take a look at it seriously.
It's one of those backlog items that you never really get around to :)

Anyways, I finally decided to categorise my existing Computer Science Markdown notes that I've accumulated whilst studying and host them on [Github pages here](https://burrt.github.io/compsci-docs/).
This was the beginnings of my Jekyll journey and as we all say - It's much harder to start than to continue.

My old website was simply using an existing Bootstrap static website template and I basically dumped everything in the HTML.
This was not a fun experience everytime I need to add or modify stuff - fortunately this occurred very rarely.
But as time goes by, the more something bugs you, you'll eventually address it so I did!
