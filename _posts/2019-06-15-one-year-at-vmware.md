excerpt: One year working at VMware

## One year

So it's been one year working at VMware and also my first year working professionally! As with most graduates, it's always overwhelming going from full-time study to full-time work. It really has been one hell of a ride.

## What I've learnt

Coming from a Computer Engineering background, I had minimal understanding of software engineering practices. The courses I took focused very little on how to write "good" code and the OO course was a far cry from the real-world.

### Code

Even though I didn't know any C#/.NET, I was given plenty of time and resources to quickly ramp up. Couple that with mentors and observing the constant stream of pull requests, I was able to comfortably code in a month or so.

It takes time to distinguish what is considered "good" code and what is "sub-optimal". The best part is that it's a constant learning process.

### Documentation

At uni, documentation was unheard of - so at work, they exist! But I've also come to realise that documentation is time consuming to write and even **harder** to maintain the quality of them. The reason being, a lot of the time documentation is written and then forgotten - it takes team discipline to keep them healthy.

## What's tough

At uni, a common joke with your mates is about group projects :) Well, when you start work, you'll be joining a team and staying in that team! This meant that I needed to quickly adapt and find a sense of rhythm to my workflow. This sounds pretty easy for a lot of people, but it took some time for me.

It could even be as basic as mustering the energy for working 5 days a week; or consistently coding away and making progress (productivity); or even remembering everyone's names!

### Messaging

For the most part for uni projects, Facebook messenger and some crude methods of using Git were sufficient. So seeing the effective use of Slack in the development workflow was really interesting and it's a shame that the UNSW Engineering faculty didn't adopted it during my studies.

With all collaborative tools like Slack, it can get pretty overwhelming at times when the messages come thick and fast. Keeping tabs on questions and answers, and coding can be a pretty busy process!

### Meetings

This is the classic developer (or just everyone) joke where meetings are seen as disruptive, unproductive and unnecessary - we all just want to put our heads down and code code code! Coming from uni where you can just about do that and simply have a quick chat about stuff in class or your break, having regular meetings took some time adjusting to.

Part of the agile workflow is to have regular standups , retrospectives and additional meetings e.g. sprint reviews. Depending on your team, these could be more or less.

## After thoughts

For me, I have always been interested in team dynamics and perhaps more so after working in the same team. What I mean by this is:

1. Team culture
2. Individuals

### Team culture

I've come to realise how *difficult* it is to cultivate a health team culture and how easy it is for it to degrade. Understanding and noticing the small nuances of team dynamics take a lot of time - meaning, what appears on the surface can tell a really different story below. I've also made efforts to observe other teams that are not engineering e.g. marketing and compare their operations.

### Individuals

This may sound odd but any discussion about teams must also include individuals since teams are made up of individuals! Whether it be uni, sport or work, I have always strived to excel in my actions and if possible, for the team to as well. After working in largely the same team for a year, I've made several observations that have caused me adjust this attitude slightly.

Our team is quite multicultural and is made up of a large range of ages - diversity in thoughts and personas is to be desired but it comes with challenges in order to reap its benefits.

An important realization that I've made perhaps a little too late is that **not everyone in the team wants what you want in regards to team culture or excellence**. Not everyone wants to perform at 101% or even close to that; not everyone places much emphasis communication; not everyone provides (or can receive) constructive feedback. Or those that agree on these points may not agree on the execution.

These revelations are ever so important to consider when attempting to address any team concerns, communication and collaboration.

Sometimes when you're just a graduate and you really want things to change quickly - which I believe is a trait amongst all young people and generation shifts - it can feel fruitless. Team culture is an area I think I'll always be passionate about and I believe one day, I will be working more closely in that area.

## Back to work

This was my first year of working reflections and I still have many years ahead. I've learnt and experienced so much already; and I still have the burning passion of learning that I'm excited, impatient and eager of my future!

And with that, it's back to work :)
