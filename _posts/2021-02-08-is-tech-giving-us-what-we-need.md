## Is Tech Giving Us What We Need?

As a developer of technology, an active user of technology and an observer of technology consumption, I have often thought about this question in the last few years. Prior to that, I was that geeky kid fiddling around with Arch Linux, Android Custom ROMs and so on; but slowly these hobbies transitioned to others and in doing so I had the opportunity to reflect and view technology through a different lens.

> Is technology simplifying our lives or increasing its complexity and dependencies?

The technology sector has exploded over the last decade and 2020 has accelerated its seemingly infinite use-cases, whether that be through innovation, disruption of incumbent industries or enabling them. As a consequence, it has naturally permeated even deeper into our lives. No doubt the developers and innovators of new technologies are quick point out the overwhelming positives, but how often do we question this? Many of us are too busy (or seem like we are), stuck in the rat-race, ever-chasing the next *new thing*.

Many traditional forms of communication such as pen and paper are fast disappearing from our lives, its replacement an iPad, laptop and so on. These replacements provide more than the ability to take notes, its additions are in fact so overwhelming in comparison that it can serve as a distraction from the **primary** task at hand - to write something down. Information has never been so accessible since the inception of the World Wide Web and our ever connectedness to it - today we not only carry our mobile phones but also leverage smart watches to even further reduce our separation from the virtual world. This supposedly enables us to respond and perform tasks quicker, and therefore increased productivity, but how often have we been in situations where the person we are conversing with are distracted by that phone call or notification? And then the conversation back-tracks approximately 10 seconds and the rhythm ultimately broken. It is difficult at times to understand the rationale of this frenzied adoption of consumer technologies and the absence of a critical analysis of our changing habits and behaviors.

This cycle of intended *simplification* can also be felt in the software development lifecycle where new tools and frameworks are born - are they are re-creating the wheel or offering true value? The intention is often sensible but the execution and direction are cab be left unquestioned and/or unchallenged, particularly once they reach a certain inertia. Then, once they too become too complex and bloated, a newer tool is released, and thus the cycle repeats.

Perhaps our lives are instead accelerating in complexity due to technology, it's imperative that we stop and reassess: do we really need it?
