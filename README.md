# My website

My personal website I've created using Jekyll and Github Pages! It can be viewed at [here](https://burrt.github.io/).

## Cloning

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/burrt/burrt.github.io.git
```

## Getting Started

### Docker

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

### Linux

You can build and host the pages locally - first setup [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) in your local environment. I do recommend using Docker.

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
