# My website

My personal website I've created using Jekyll and Github Pages! It can be viewed at [here](https://burrt.github.io/).

## Cloning

```bash
$> git clone git@github.com:<username>/burrt.github.io.git
```

## Building

You can build and host the pages locally - first setup Jekyll in your local environment.

### Linux

```bash
bundle update
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
